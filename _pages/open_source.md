* **Code for Earth, European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) 2022**
  * Project: [Bringing Magics Weather maps to Matplotlib](https://github.com/ecmwf/magics-python)
  * Integrated Matplotlib to Python interface of Magics, ECMWF’s meteorological plotting software that supports plotting
contours, wind fields, observations, and satellite images. This project made Magics more pythonic, user-friendly, customizable, and extensible to interactive plotting. Also improved documentation and created tutorials.
  * Duration: May 2022 - August 2022
  * Mentors: James Varndell, [Sylvie Lamy-Thepaut](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/about/who-we-are/staff-profiles/sylvie-lamy-thepaut), [Stephan Siemen](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/about/who-we-are/staff-profiles/stephan-siemen), [Baudouin Raoult](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/about/who-we-are/staff-profiles/baudouin-raoult)
